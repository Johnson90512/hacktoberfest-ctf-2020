# Contributing
To contribute to this project, you'll need to come up with an idea for a CTF challenge. You'll need to add a folder to the root of the project and name it whatever you want.

You can use any language you wish, as there are no restrictions.

Once this repository is populated with challenges, we will be hosting a CTF challenge with the challenges provided here.
